            <p class="about">Linchpin is a society comprised of bright; like minded students in and around Presidency University who triumph in delivering the best academic oriented ideas in forms of activities, events and workshops. The pioneers of Linchpin belong from all the different schools and also hold various positions in other academic as well as cultural clubs and organizations, as this helps Linchpin put forward the peculiar interests of students from all different backgrounds instead of being mainstream. This society runs like an organization in putting forward ideas which are developed for the students by the students as this closes the gap in communication as to what exactly is needed for the masses of like minds. The structure of Linchpin is fully decentralized, breaking the regular norms as to how a club or student body operates. Doing this helps Linchpin to be heard by all its members and come to a unanimous decision in regards to what is to be delivered. Linchpin has several departments that work independently to make sure there are no external interference and disruption in the work flow. There is no primary governance over the departments as a “Core Committee” acting as a central body looks over the operations. As Linchpin is run by the students, it is easy to reach goals that the present generation seeks for.</p>
